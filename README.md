This project is a YouTube-inspired UI built from scratch using pure HTML and CSS.
I followed a tutorial as a guide, but focused on understanding and applying core concepts, not copy-pasting code.

Through this project, I practiced and strengthened my front-end fundamentals, especially how layout, positioning, and responsiveness work together to create a real-world interface.

🚀 What I learned & applied

Buttons & UI components

Custom button design

Hover effects

Tooltips

Background colors & box shadows

Typography & text handling

Font families, sizes, and styles

Line-height & spacing

Text overflow & nowrap

Layout techniques

display: block vs inline-block

Flexbox for alignment and nested layouts

CSS Grid for structured page layout

Positioning

relative, absolute, fixed

Understanding how each behaves in real layouts

Responsive design

Media queries

Adapting the layout based on screen size

🎯 Goal of the project

The goal wasn’t to perfectly clone YouTube, but to deeply understand how modern UIs are built, how layouts scale, and how different CSS features interact in a real application.

This project represents a strong foundation in HTML & CSS, and prepares me for more advanced front-end work.
